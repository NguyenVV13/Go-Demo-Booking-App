This project is a demo app that was used to learn the syntax and basic concepts of Go in a small project instead of pure, isolated examples. The user inputs basic information, which is used for "booking" and "sending" travel tickets.

This project follows the tutorial created by TechWorld with Nana, video below:

This tutorial executes purely on the CLI. Expansions to this project would be to make it a webapp that takes input, saves the ticket and user data into a database, and lands the user onto a confirmation page.
